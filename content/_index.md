# AirBnB in New York City

### By Julie Olin, Julian Skovhus & Mik Lokdam

AirBnB is an online platform that accommodate guests with short-term lodging options that is mainly provided by private hosts. AirBnB is mainly used by travellers when looking for homestay rentals for a vacation and was founded by Brian Chesky in August 2008. Since the incorporation, AirBnB has experienced an exponential growth and now accounts for upwards of 20% of the vacation rental industry as a whole.

In New York City (NYC), more than 48.000 listings were available for rent in 2019. Listings range from a whole penthouse apartment with panorama view overlooking Central Park to a shared bedroom in Brooklyn and with the vast variety in accommodation options, NYC is set to fullfill the need of any traveller. As a tourist, it may be overwhelming to choose a place to stay in NYC as NYC is a very diverse city with 5 boroughs. Also, each borough contains serveral districts, each with their own charm and caracteristics. Should travellers choose to stay in the posh Manhattan, the hip Bronx or the cultural Brooklyn? And which characteristics defines each of these borough?

We help answer this. Let us start out with some basic stats to outline some differences between the 5 boroughs. The listings are distributed as follow:

One thing to notice is Manhattan and Brooklyn. Although Manhattan and Brooklyn make up 50% of the total population in NYC, they make up more than 85% of the total AirBnB listings. This indicate that these boroughs are attractive to tourists. Not surprisingly, because who wouldn't stay near the iconic Brooklyn Bridge or Times Square, dubbed 'the center of the world'?

Looking at price differences visualised below, it is clear that Manhattan is also the most expensive borough, while Brooklyn follows approx. the same price pattern as the other boroughs.
